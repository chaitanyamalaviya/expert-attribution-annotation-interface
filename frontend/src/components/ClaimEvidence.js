                Each claim is a sentence, accompanied with the evidence for the sentence returned by the system.

                <ol>
                    <li> Complete: The claim is fully entailed by the evidence. </li>
                    <li> Partial: Not all facts in the claim are fully entailed by the evidence. </li>
